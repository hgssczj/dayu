Dayu is a cloud-edge stream analytics platform for deploying, scheduling, and operating DAG-based AI
pipelines across heterogeneous nodes. It combines a backend control plane, a Vue frontend, simulated datasources, and a
runtime collaboration layer for generator, scheduler, controller, processor, distributor, and monitor services.

## Why Dayu

- DAG-based multi-stage stream analytics with dynamic task configuration and offloading
- Hook-based runtime extension for generator, scheduler, processor, monitor, and visualization behavior
- Built-in deployment composition using policy catalogs, component templates, and processor service templates
- Backend-managed result visualization, system telemetry snapshots, and compressed log export
- Compatibility with heterogeneous cloud and edge nodes through a KubeEdge and Sedna oriented deployment model

## Architecture at a Glance

Dayu is composed of five layers:

- **Basic System Layer**: This layer adopts the `KubeEdge` architecture and is deployed on all distributed nodes across
  the cloud-edge environment. `KubeEdge` is the `Kubernetes` extension proposed by Huawei for edge scenarios and can be
  well deployed on devices with limited resources and low performance.
- **Intermediate Interface Layer**: This layer is designed to offer customized service installation and component
  communication, through modifying and expanding official interface component `Sedna` and communication component
  `Edgemesh`.
- **System Support Layer**: This layer is designed to offer interactive ui (frontend), automatic installation (backend),
  and simulation datasource (datasource) for users.
- **Collaboration Scheduling Layer**: This layer is composed of functional components independently developed by us to
  complete functions such as pipeline task execution and scheduling collaboration.
- **Application Service Layer**: This layer accepts user-defined service applications. As long as the user develops
  service according to the interface requirements defined by the platform, it can be embedded in the platform as a
  container and complete execution across cloud-edge nodes.

## Tutorials and Guides

To get detailed instructions about our dayu system, please refer to the documentation on
the [homepage](https://dayu-autostreamer.github.io/).

Please refer to our [quick start tutorial](https://dayu-autostreamer.github.io/docs/) for a quick start
of the dayu system.

If you want to further develop dayu for your needs, please refer to
our [development tutorial](https://dayu-autostreamer.github.io/docs/developer-guide/how-to-develop).

## Implementation Documentation

Dayu now keeps implementation-facing technical documentation in the repository, while the public website remains the
best place for tutorials and end-user walkthroughs.

## Ecosystem

Dayu is designed around the following ecosystem:

- [Docker Container](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce)
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- [KubeEdge](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge)
- [Sedna](https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna)
- [EdgeMesh](https://github.com/kubeedge/edgemesh)
- [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT)

Dayu also depends on the maintained companion work around Sedna and EdgeMesh integration:

- [dayu-sedna](https://github.com/dayu-autostreamer/dayu-sedna)
- [dayu-edgemesh](https://github.com/dayu-autostreamer/dayu-edgemesh)

## Local Testing

To align local testing with CI, use the repository-declared toolchain:

- Python `3.8` via [`.python-version`](.python-version)
- Node.js `20` via [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)
- `make` as the primary local task entry point

Python developer dependencies are collected in [`requirements-dev.txt`](requirements-dev.txt), and Python lint
configuration lives in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

Use the provided `Makefile` targets for local feedback loops:

```bash
make install-python-dev
make lint-python
make python-syntax
make test-unit-integration
make test-component
make test-e2e
make coverage-python
make frontend-install
make frontend-check
make check
```

`make check` is the day-to-day aggregate gate. `make coverage-python` mirrors the Python coverage run used by hosted CI.
`make frontend-lint` remains available as a cleanup target while the frontend template debt continues to be reduced
incrementally.
